# DeepClean-Detect
Underwater environments present unique challenges for object detection due to factors such as poor visibility, varying lighting conditions, and complex backgrounds. Through this introduces an advanced underwater object detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm and GAN to address these challenges effectively. 
The system is trained on a comprehensive dataset of underwater images to enhance its ability to recognize and classify objects in low-visibility conditions. To enhance its effectiveness, the system is meticulously trained on a comprehensive dataset of underwater images, enabling it to recognize and classify objects even in low-visibility conditions. The YOLO-based system demonstrates robust performance across a diverse range of underwater objects, including marine life, submerged structures, and potential hazards. The YOLO-based system demonstrates robust performance across a diverse range of underwater objects, including marine life, submerged structures, and potential hazards. Underwater trash detection helps prevent pollution, protects aquatic life, and promotes sustainable use of our oceans. By efficiently addressing these challenges, this advanced YOLO-based system becomes a valuable tool for ensuring the responsible exploration and utilization of underwater resources. Overall, it improves efficiency and safety across diverse industries.
