# DeepClean-Detect
Underwater environments present unique challenges for object detection due to factors such as poor visibility, varying lighting conditions, and complex backgrounds. Through this introduces an advanced underwater object detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm and GAN to address these challenges effectively.
